        <h3>Alderaan</h3>
        <p>
          Alderaan (/ˈɔːldərɑːn, -ræn/) is a blue-green in appearance, depicted
          as a terrestrial planet with humanoid inhabitants, and characterized
          by a peaceful culture. Alderaan played a pivotal role in the
          establishment of the Rebel Alliance, a movement that sought to restore
          the Old Republic's values. Because of its ties with the Alliance, the
          planet was destroyed when Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin decided to test
          the superlaser of the Death Star, a moon-sized battle station
          developed by the Empire, at full strength.

        <h3>Coruscant</h3>
        <p>
          Coruscant (pronounced /'kɔɹəsɑnt/), also known as Imperial Center
          during the rule of the Galactic Empire, was an ecumenopolis—a
          city-covered planet, collectively known as Imperial City— in the
          Coruscant system of the Core Worlds. Though debated by historians, it
          was generally believed that Coruscant was the original homeworld of
          humanity.

        <h3>Korriban</h3>
        <p>
          Korriban, known as Pesegam during the reign of Xim, and also known as
          Moraband by the time of the Clone Wars, was the sole planet in the
          Horuset system, located across the galaxy from Koros Major. It was the
          original homeworld of the Sith species and a sacred planet for the
          Sith Order, housing the tombs for many ancient and powerful Dark Lords
          of the Sith, and containing immense dark side power.
